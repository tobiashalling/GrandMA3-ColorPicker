This GrandMA3 Colorpicker is a port of my earlier work with the GrandMA2 colorpicker. 
Credits go to: Christian Jackson and AGuyNamedJonas

The script is solely made with MA3 commands, hence no fancy programming besides variables, loops and such is used.
You as user should therefore easily be able to modify the script to your specific needs. 

You can download and modify the script as you will. 

Feel free to commit issues with the code and give constructive feedback

Happy programming
